# To start the project:

### `> npm i`
### `> npm start`

Unfortunately, I did not have enough time to implement everything planned in the project. It's been a busy sprint at my job. I had to leave the project without testing coverage, I didnâ€™t have time to add the library for gradually load the list of games and many other little things.

However, what I have done:
- spa with game list data loading
- the ability to add games to favorites
- the ability to go to the game page
- ability to filter by category
- search by game name
- data request error handling
- 404 page handling

Technologies used:
- create-react-app to quickly start a project
- redux to manage application state
- redux-thunk for asynchronous request
- react-router to work with routing in the application
- prop-types library for description of data types of props
- sass, css variables and classnames library to work with styles
- react-lorem-ipsum to generate game descriptions

I hope the application works correctly, but if not, please contact me. 
Thank you for your attention.
